# CARL: Computer-Assisted Response Labeler

## Overview
--------

Computer-Assisted Response Labeler (CARL) is a MATLAB GUI tool that aims to speed-up manual labeling of verbal responses in experimental paradigms. It has been particularly developed with the goal of speeding up the labeling of experimental verbal recordings from e.g., memory recall or verbal Stroop task versions.

It facilitates labeling by (a) splitting long recordings into word chunks (if not provided as a basis for labeling), (b) automatically pre-labeling of word periods based on sound energy, (c) allowing quick manual refinement of sound on- and offsets via drag and drop, (d) providing a few options for label speed-up, e.g., auto-starting only the pre-labeled portions of the recording, (e) allows to manually split chunks containing multiple words into separate ‘trials’/segments.


A project wiki for CARL is available [here](https://github.com/jkosciessa/CARL/wiki).
